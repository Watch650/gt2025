# Let G be an undirected graph. Prove that the sum of the degrees of vertices of G is always an even number
#   + Using the matrix representation, find all the connected component of each graph
#   + Prove that the number of vertices of odd degree in any graph G is even
#   + To implement the PathExistence(G, s, v) algo
#   + To implement an algo tha given (G, s, t) return the squence of vertices that composes the path
#   + Given a graph and a path, to develop an algo for checking if the path is unique
